### Run it :

Important conventions in Go :

- If the functions with names that start with an uppercase letter will be exported to other packages. If the function name starts with a lowercase letter, it won't be exported to other packages, but you can call this function within the same package.
- If a name consists of multiple words, each word after the first should be capitalized like this: empName, EmpAddress, etc
